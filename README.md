# This is a university project for Natural language processing course 
The aim of this project is to create several models for predicting movie reviews based on their contents and compare accuracy between them selecting the best one. 
Reviews are downloaded from the internet.

## Project compares such classic Machine learning models as follows:
- Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- Sklearn Classifier
- Combined Classifier from 3 above listed 

## Next also neural newtorks were used 
- Based on Bag of Words representation 
- Basend on embeddings trained on Wikipedia 2014 

## In order to run project you need to make some installation via pip in your project directory: 
```console
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install nltk
pip install sklearn
```
You will need also to install PyTorch, you can to do this via this [link](https://pytorch.org) and choose appropriate version
